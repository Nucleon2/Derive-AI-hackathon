# EthosAI -- Hackathon Submission

## Project Title

EthosAI

## Short Description

EthosAI reads your Ethereum wallet history, figures out your trading habits, and gives you honest, personalized behavioral insights, plus a Discord voice coach that talks you through it in real time.

## Long Description

Most crypto tools focus on price charts and trading signals. Nobody tells you about *your own patterns* -- the fact that you tend to panic-swap into volatile tokens right after a dip, or that you overtrade during late-night sessions. EthosAI does that.

You paste your Ethereum wallet address, and EthosAI pulls your full on-chain history from Etherscan. It looks at your transactions, token transfers, trade frequency, holding durations, and risk exposure. Then it runs that through a behavioral analyzer pipeline that identifies your dominant patterns, flags potential risk signals, and asks you reflection questions you probably haven't thought about.

Want to go deeper on a specific token? Paste the contract address. EthosAI pulls market data from CoinGecko, correlates your transfer activity with price movements, and tells you things like "you tend to make large transfers right before price drops" or "your timing on this token has actually been solid."

The Discord voice coach takes it further. Link your wallet to your Discord account, join a voice channel, and type `/coach`. The bot joins, listens to you talk about whatever's on your mind, and responds in real time with context from your actual wallet history. It knows your patterns. It's not generic advice, it's a conversation grounded in your real behavior. You can interrupt it mid-sentence, and it stops and listens.

Everything gets persisted. Your analyses build up over time so you can see how your behavior evolves. Coaching sessions are logged with summaries, topics discussed, and nudges delivered.

EthosAI is built for anyone who trades crypto and wants to understand themselves better, not get told what to buy. It's awareness, not advice.
